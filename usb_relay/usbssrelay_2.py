#Simplicity and understandability is the primary philosophy followed while
#writing this code. Sometimes at the expence of standard coding practices and
#best practices. It is your responsibility to independantly assess and implement
#coding practices that will satisfy safety and security necessary for your final

#This demo code demonstrates how to turn ON, OFF, read a relay, set, clear, read a GPIO and read an analog channel.
